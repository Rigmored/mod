Galadriel, Celeborn, and Amroth (not yet adopted)
========================================================
Amroth was originally the son of Galadriel and Celeborn, During the late 2nd and early 3rd age, Galadriel and Celeborn dwelth in Dol Amroth, near Edhellond. The area was called 'the country of Amroth where the Nandor Elves still dwell' in 'Adarion and Erendis', which implies the name pre-dates the death of Amroth (because the tale of his death makes clear that Edhellond was in it's last gasp). Amroth became King of Lorinand early, but often visited his parents.

Later, this was dropped. After the destruction of Eregion, Galadriel went to Lindon and Celeborn went to Lorinand temporarily. However, this leaves unquestioned the problem of where Galadriel and Celeborn were for almost 3500 years afterwards, and why/how Dol Amroth and 'the country of Amroth' was named (for an Elf-King who only visited the area once, to die, 2 thousand years after it was established as a Númenorian/Gondoran stronghold).

So, my history:
• Late 1st age or early 2nd age: G & C 'pass over the mountains' and organize a 'realm' by Lake Nenuial.
• Later, Eregion is founded by a group of mostly Noldorin lords and ladies, including G & C. Annatar (Sauron) arrives and 'befriends' most the Eregion Nobility (including Celebrimbor, thier chief), but Galadriel declines, gets upset and abandons Eregion, moving to Lorinand. She gets a barony.
• Thr War of the Elves and Sauron. Eregion is destroyed, with Celeborn and many refugees moving to Lorinand via Khazad-dûm. As Lorinand is likely to come under attack, Amdír sends Amroth south with many refugees down the Anduin (and causing trouble in Sauron's rear). The pre-existing realm of Edhellond grows in size and population, and after the previous ruler decided to sail west, Amroth becomes the new ruler.
• Lorinand and Khazad-dûm come under assault by Sauron, with Galadriel and Celeborn aiding in the defence. After it is done, Celeborn gets a county, but Galadriel has sea-longing, so she heads to Edhellond. She gets a county there.
• After the downfall of Númenor, Edhellond has decreased in population, so Dol Amroth is given to the Faithful.
• After the Final Alliance war, Amroth takes up the kingship of Lorien, and Galadriel gets a county there, dropping the depopulated county near Edhellond (to gondor).


A Rough History of Eraidor
==================================
• Tolkien himself mentions very little about first age Eraidor. What we know: Various groups passed through Eraidor to get to Beleriand. There was a substantial population of Edain (including probably the people of Bereg, coming back from Beleriand). The Dwarves already had cities at Khazad-dûm and Gundabad. Orcs fleeing the downfall of Morgoth came into conflict with them and likely took Gundabad (since orcs are said to have 'retaken' it during the War of the Elves and Sauron).
• In LOTR, Galadriel states that she and Celeborn 'passed over the mountains' before Gondolin or Nargothrond fell, but the appendices contradict this. Other material states that early second age she dwelt by the shores of lake Evendim (this is typically ignored).
• In the mod, a number of elven rulers living in what later became Lórien are listed as being killed 4785 (~year of the sun 470) with the note : 'Slain on Caras Galadhon by Balrogs in pursuit of the Host of Súlwë'. Súlwë is a Noldor also listed in those histories, but there is no other information anywhere else.
• Also, Durin the deathless and some other dwarven leaders are listed as dying in 4892 (just before the War of Wrath), with the note 'Morgoth besiges Khazad-dum'

• Those likely living in Eraidor: Edain (confirmed), Haladian peoples (known to be in south Eraidor c 1200 SA), Easterlings (came into Beleriand from northwest Eraidor), Nandorin Elves (the green elves crossed Eraidor from Lindórinand, some probably stayed), Ents (Treebeard made vague allusions as to the old forests that once covered large regions of Eraidor). Other Elves probably also crossed from Beleriand before the War of Wrath as conditions declined.

• The Dwarven food-for-crafts trade with Humans was apparently slow to develop, and 'of Dwarves and Men' only really paid attention to East of the Misty Mountains. My inference is that the Dwarves were hunter-gatherers who were non-nomadic. This is normally only possible for Humans in very rich areas, but as an alternative, large areas near Dwarven settlements could have been used by organized Dwarven parties to forage on a large scale for others. The Entwives taught agriculture to the Edain, who settled mostly on the Eastern side of the Misty Mountains, those who went west settled out of easy reach.

• So the Western flanks of the Misty Mountains were probably only lightly settled, by primitive Humans and Dwarven foragers. After the the War of Wrath, Dwarves of the Blue Mountains who fled to Khazad-dûm introduced the concept of food-for-crafts trade, and the Edain were already there east of the mountains. At the same time, Orcs fleeing from Morgoth's downfall attacked. So the alliance developed.

• Some sort of Human-Dwarf relationship seems likely on the eastern flanks of the Blue mountains as well.

• Issue: 'Of Dwarves and Men' states that during the War of the Jewels and the Siege of Angband, Orcs ceased to attack the Longbeards. However, the westwards migrations of Men were driven by a desire to flee Morgoth's minions. Also, the mod notes in the character histories are inconsistent with this.

• It is stated that at least early in the second age, Gil-Galad claimed dominion over all of Eraidor.

• Second age movements: 'Aldarion and Erendis' states that 'dark men out of the mountains were thrusting into Enedwaith' C 1100 (also 'Men near the coasts were growing afraid of the Númenóreans, or were become openly hostile'). The Númenórean settlement picked up c 1200 by Lond Daer. The War of the Elves and Sauron was very destructive. Imladris was founded. Afterwards, Númenórean settlement picked up on the shores, and MERP states there was a northerly migration from Dunland as far as Rhudaur.
• The Númenóreans and their settlement caused great destruction to the southern forests, and was opposed by the inhabitants, who might have included Ents.

That's pretty much it. the rest will have to made up.
