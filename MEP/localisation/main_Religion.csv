#Mori Elves
religion_moriquendi_DESC;The Elves, or Eldar, were the first of the races of the Children of Ilúvatar, known also as the Firstborn for that reason.

Instead, they lingered on the shores of Middle-earth or never passed the Blue Mountains and remained in the East. Most Elves fall into this category, the others being the Calequendi, or Elves of the Light. \n\nThe main cultural groups of Elves in the Third Age are §YSilvan§!, §YSindar§!, and §YNoldor§!, also known as the Wood Elves, Grey People, and High Elves respectively. \n-------------- \n§YCultural Troop Combat Bonuses§! \nSilvan/Avari: §G+250.00%§! \nSindar/Nandor: §G+400.00%§! \nNoldor Combat Bonus: §G+500.00%§! \n\n§YRacial Bonuses/Maluses§! \nOrganisation: §G+100.00%§! \nMorale: §G+100.00%§! \nLevy Size: §R-75.00%§! \nLevy Reinforcement Rate: §R-95.00%§! \nCombat in §YForest§!: §G+20.00%§!;Le groupe culturel de ce personnage.;;;;;x

The term Calaquendi usually applies only to those Elves who actually lived in Eldamar. The Moriquendi included all other Elves, whether or not they had participated in the March to Valinor. The Moriquendi were regarded as greatly inferior by the Calaquendi, who lived in the Light of the Two Trees, and had also received great knowledge and powers by living with the Valar and Maiar. \n\nThe main cultural groups of Elves in the Third Age are §YSilvan§!, §YSindar§!, and §YNoldor§!, also known as the Wood Elves, Grey People, and High Elves respectively. \n-------------- \n§YCultural Troop Combat Bonuses§! \nSilvan/Avari: §G+250.00%§! \nSindar/Nandor: §G+400.00%§! \nNoldor Combat Bonus: §G+500.00%§! \n\n§YRacial Bonuses/Maluses§! \nOrganisation: §G+100.00%§! \nMorale: §G+100.00%§! \nLevy Size: §R-75.00%§! \nLevy Reinforcement Rate: §R-95.00%§! \nCombat in §YForest§!: §G+20.00%§!;Le groupe culturel de ce personnage.;;;;;x
