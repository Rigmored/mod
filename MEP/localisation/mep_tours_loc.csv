EVTTTLmep_tours_events.1;[tour_target.GetFullBaseName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.1gondor;You see the massive pinnacle of the White Tower, renamed in honor of Steward Ecthelion II, as you cross the Pelennor Fields, approaching Minas Tirith. In short order you pass the massive whitestone ringwall through the city gate and explore the city's tiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.1rohan;You pass through the crowded city streets of Edoras, on the hilltop above you sits the Golden Hall, Meduseld, shimmering in the sunlight. Through the gate to the main road, along which the clear spring watersand Snowbourn flow. Before leaving the Harrowdale, you visit the ancestral tombs in the Barrowfield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.1mordor;You enter the murky courtyard of the Dark Tower, it's fiery light painting the landscape a dusky crimson, as a sense of forbearance grows in you. The air hangs heavy on you, choked with sulfur and ash from ever-spewing Mt. Doom, making each breath a pain. You approach the keep itself but danger pushes you away and toward to the Northern Road.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_tours_events.1;An incredible City;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_tours_events.1;If only I could've met such Mighty Kings of Old.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_tours_events.1;I must find a way through.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_tours_events.11;[tour_target.GetFullBaseName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.11gondor;You come to the ruins of Gondor's once-jewel, awed by the sight even now in its delapidated state. You walk through the collapsed buildings and along the rubble-lined pathways. Eventually, coming to a mighty, but rundown, domed building as the day's light fades.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.11rohan;You turn off the Main road to Edoras towards the White Mountains. You reach the base of the mountains and spend a few minutes searching for the Stair of the Hold you were told about then make your way up the winding path to a large, grassy plateau. There, you look out on the vast plains of the Riddermark.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.11mordor;The horizon turns pitch black as you make your way towards the Black Gate. As you grow closer, sunlight barely passes the stoneworks. Enough light enters the area that you can makeout the structure of several Stone Turrets along the interior of the gate. When you reach the gate, however, the guards refuse you passage and you are forced to turn back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_tours_events.11;The Grand Dome of Stars, Incredible;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_tours_events.11;Hello, hello, ello.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_tours_events.11;There must be another way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_tours_events.12;[tour_target.GetFullBaseName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.12gondor;The Stone road leads along the Anduin and onward to the Great Harbor City. You enter the city proper and make way through the winding paths, bleached stone buildings marking the boundaries. As you walk along, you come to a grand palace, its foundation submerged in the sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.12rohan;Light seems to die around you as you walk the shadow-cast, stone-lined roadway in the mountain. Carved in the mountain before you are the doorway trees of Dimholt and the Path of the Dead beyond but as you approach the doorway and read the engravings, a shiver runs down your spine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.12mordor;You turn off the road to the north and to the Carach Angren, the narrow pass in the Mountains. You make your way through the many fortresses and watchtowers that line the pass and come to the bridge, but as you do, a riot breaks out amongst the Orcs of the pass which soon erupts into a full scale battle as more and more pour in. So you turn back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_tours_events.12;I can't believe it, Tarannon's Palace;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_tours_events.12;I must turn back, the way is shut.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_tours_events.12;What luck...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_tours_events.13;[tour_target.GetFullBaseName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.13gondor;Long before you catch glimpse of the famed Tower, Tirith Aear, you hear a great toll carrying on the wind across the plains. The once faint ring grows into a crashing boom as you approach the tower's grounds. The guards eye you as you enter the grand structure, though you continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.13rohan;You make your way across the plains of the Riddermark to the Grand Fortess of the Hornburg, built Ages ago by the Numenoreans. Pulling up your hood, you make your way inside. You sneak through the guarded door to the Deeping Wall and marvel at it's ramparts, noting the culvert and stream as you return to the Fortress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.13mordor;You enter the pale-lit courtyards of the silent city, the ground all around you bathed in soft, sickly, white. The flowers of the great meadows corrupted by the touch of evil. You push yourself onward toward the ghastly, vapor-veiled citadel before you, its tower enveloped in the moonlight. But a wyerven shreiks and Orcs pour out of the gate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_tours_events.13;I can't wait to look out on the Sea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_tours_events.13;What force could breach such a stalwart Citadel?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCmep_tours_events.14rohan;You hire a trotter and head for the East-mark region to visit the ancient city of Aldburg along the way. You arrive at the outergate shortly after Noon, turning in your rental, and, upon entering the city, are greeted by the clamor of bustling crowds and horses. The next day you continue your journey through Rohan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.14mordor;You come to the high western passage of Cirith Ungol, at its pinnacle is the Blackstone Tower. You make your way up the steep slope and come to the Tower, casting off a cold shadowy light. You consider resting withint the lower walls but the Orcs screeching inside deters you. So you continue down the western slope and greet the plains of Gondor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCmep_tours_events.102A;You breathe a sigh of a relief as you emerge into a tunnel, ahead of you is the moonlight. You catch the glint of metal out of the corner of your eye. You dig up an anciet dagger, still sharp as new.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.102B;You smile wide as you enter an open room, moon's light bathing you from a partially open door. You spot a pile of wood nearby and use a piece begin to pry open the door. As it opens you feel warmt from the staff.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
