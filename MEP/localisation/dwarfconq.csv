EVTTITdwarfconq.71;The matter of Khazad-dûm;;;;;;x
EVTDESCdwarfconq.71a;Erebor is thriving, but dark clouds are on the Horizon. Orcs are building there numbers and the Easterlings seem likely to march again, with orders from Mordor.\n\nDespite all of this, many are still talking of Khazad-dûm, as if the Longbeards have the strength to wrest if from the clutches of Evil. You know better however. You well remember the time, when you were young, you gazed past the eastern gate doors of Khazad-dûm and saw it... Durin's Bane. No Dwarven army could destroy such an evil, not without help. Balin and his followers, who thought otherwise, have not been heard from in years.\n\nDespite this, Balin's son, Burin, has been claiming the lordship of Moria, as if he stood a chance of seizing it. This seems most unseemly, since you are the King of the Longbeards, the rightful rules of Khazad-dûm... even if actually retaking it seems very unlikely.\n\nBut not impossible to those who wait for the right chance.;;;;;;x

EVTDESCdwarfconq.73;Erebor is thriving, but dark clouds are on the Horizon. Orcs are building there numbers and the Easterlings seem likely to march again, with orders from Mordor.\n\nDespite all of this, many are still talking of Khazad-dûm, as if the Longbeards have the strength to wrest if from the clutches of Evil. King Dáin thought otherwise, and having seen Durin's Bane with his own eyes, he was likely correct. Balin and his followers, who dared to settle in what is now Moria, have not been heard from in years. Retaking Khazad-dûm seems very unlikely.\n\nBut if you wait, perhaps an opportunity will arise.;;;;;;x
