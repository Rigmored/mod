#Mori Elves
religion_moriquendi_DESC;The Elves, or Eldar, were the first of the races of the Children of Ilúvatar, known also as the Firstborn for that reason.

Instead, they lingered on the shores of Middle-earth or never passed the Blue Mountains and remained in the East.

The term Calaquendi usually applies only to those Elves who actually lived in Eldamar. The Moriquendi included all other Elves, whether or not they had participated in the March to Valinor.
