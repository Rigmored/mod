# Feudal Government Types added for x15
just_feudal_government;Just Feudalism;;;;;;x
just_feudal_government_desc;Just Feudal government revolves around the oath between liege and vassal, but is more harmonious than normal Feudalism. Peace between vassals is normal, and unjust revocation of titles is forbidden. Holders of Evil government types can be revoked with no objections from other lords, however, and this government types cannot be used by those Corrupted by Darkness. Feudal lords can only directly own so many Holdings before they must start to rely on vassals - whose loyalty may vary... There are several Succession Laws to pick between - each with its own merits. The Centralization Law controls the maximum size of your Demesne and the number of direct vassals you can have. If you should become Corrupted by Darkness, your government form will change to Feudal.;;;;;;x
hobbit_thaindom;Hobbit Thaindom;;;;;;x
hobbit_thaindom_desc;Although the Thain is a hereditary, Feudal position, the Hobbits of the Shire lack a titled aristrocracy, rather having a Gentry of powerful families. There is also little internal tension between towns and countryside, or Thain and Mayor.;;;;;;x
darklord_government;Dark Despotism;;;;;;x
darklord_government_desc;The Dark Lord has near absolute power. The Orcs and Trolls under his sway must obey. His vassals must not object to levies for any war, defensive or not. He can revoke and imprison without reason, and can revoke lesser vassals at will.;;;;;;x
orc_government;Orcish Despotism;;;;;;x
orc_government_desc;Orcs and Trolls (and for now, Spiders and Wights), care not for all that is kind and just, like the Evil Dark Lords. However, they lack the power to enforce obesiance in the same way that Dark Lords can.;;;;;;x
# Renamed Government Type...
muslim_government;Haradrim Government;;;;;;x
muslim_government_desc;The Haradrim Government system is similar to the Feudal system - rulers must rely on land holding vassals of varying loyalty and ambition. The maximum number of vassals and the number of Holdings you can directly own are controlled by the Centralization Law. However, there is only one form of Succession available - the chaotic 'Open' type, where the son with most land inherits.;;;;;;x
