-------MIDDLE-EARTH PROJECT----------

#### 0.6b HOTFIX #2 ####
- Fixed a bug where the steward can't be send to a wilderness province to colonize it.
- Added the trait "elven blood" to Elfwine the Fair, grandson of Imrahil and son of Eomer.
- Give the title of the Swans Knights of Dol Amroth to new non-dynastic characters instead of the Prince of Dol Amroth.
- The Courtiers of the Captain of the Swans Knights of Dol Amroth will have the "Knights of Dol Amroth" traits
- Gave back the Belfalas to the heirs of Imrahil during the New Shadow

#### 0.6b HOTFIX ####
- Fixed a crash because of performance in 1th february, governments vanilla values are settled
- Added several characters to Bookmarks selection screen (Fall of Arnor, Kinstrife)
- Changed death dates for numenoreans with the traits "Blood of Anarion / blood of Isildur", so they won't die around 150 years old, but around 200-220.
- Changed the max age in the ruler designer to 350 instead of 50
- Fixed a bug with bearded elves
- Fixed a bug with inheritance of elf trait / trait given to random characters
- Fixed a bug where Osgiliath is holded by the heirs of Isildur before 9980


#### 0.6b Changelog ####
- Compatibility to CKII 2.5.x
- Added two new bookmarks
- Expanded several lines to new bookmarks
- Added some new portraits
- Numenorean characters of medium blood now should die at around 120ish, those of high blood at around 150ish. This is modified by things like date (earlier bookmarks the Dunedain have not waned so much), health, whether you have elven blood or are of the royal lines, etc.
- NOT FIXED: War of the Ring event chain. It probably needs to be redone entirely. Sometimes it works brilliantly, sometimes it half works, sometimes it doesn't work at all. If you find it doesn't work and you want it to, just start over, it's only the first 5-6 years we're talking about anyways.
- Army sizes are all off, and I can't find the old settings. Increased orc levy size from 100% to 200%, gave them a bit more combat maluses. Removed combat bonuses for black numenoreans for light infantry, pikemen, archers, and light cavalry - they would use slave troops, not black numenoreans for these ranks.
- Feudal governments can now call vassals during wars. It doesn't make sense that in the wars of Middle-Earth, which tend to be quite conclusive, powerful vassals will just sit by and only give a small percentage of their troops due to some realm law or another. Wars in Middle-Earth tend to be epic all-in affairs.
- Removed elven childhood restriction for councillors. Was causing a lot of lag as AI kept appointing and then removing endlessly.
- Code optimizations, moved a lot of events to on_actions. Also deleted many not-used events from on_actions, such as the RoI ones and such. The mod still runs a bit slower than I would expect, but it's faster than Warhammer and the other big ones, though not as fast as Birthright (which is odd, since Birthright and the MEP are roughly the same size).

- A lot of the old slightly modded vanilla files were still in the mod, from several patches ago some of them. These were removed, and now the mod uses a lot more unmodded vanilla files.
- This means that until an MEP team goes through them all again with more recent versions of the files, many of the restrictions have been removed that were there previously. Sauron can take up gardening, Elrond can (probably) try to seduce Arwen, and whatever other kind of silliness that might arise. Yeah, it's not ideal, but updating all files to the more recent versions is better than having old and potentially buggy files in the mod.
- The mod now uses vanilla CBs, only slightly modded (in that holy wars cost piety and have a faster cooldown period). This means that things like subjugations etc are in.
- Generally, the mod should - hopefully - be more stable now and play more like vanilla in some areas. Restrictions we had in place that prevented dunedain vassals etc from rebelling are also removed, so you may very well now see Imrahil plotting to overthrow Denethor or have a bloody civil war in the Shire as the Tooks wage ruthless war on the Bagginses. Rivenell, Lindon, and the dwarves of the Blue Mountains also tend to expand into the wilderness duchies. Again, it's not ideal, but fixing all those old files would simply take longer than I was willing to commit to.


##### 0.5.1b Patch Changelog #####

- Evil rulers now have the 'create orc' decision
- Fixed broken trigger for fall of arnor event chain

##### 0.5b Changelog #####

TLDR:
- WoL and HL features integrated
- Perfomance massively increased
- Many bug fixes and tweaks
- Population mechanics added
- Colonisation tweaked
- Wilderness overhauled
- Playable holy orders (Swan Knights, Black Serpent)
- Map changes, Mirkwood appearance overhauled

-Removed buggy and recurring events from wotr informing that hobbits have left, and that rohan is under attack
-Deleted file MEP_Narsil, it was causing CTD with aragorn and I dont see why narsil should be so easily reforged anyways
-Removed all those wilderness holdings from Aragorn, had to give them to new wilderness chars, since he always got them even though holder was set to 0 due to inheritance i suppose
-Deleted events buildings 100, 101, and 102. They were buggy and kept repeating endlessly when holding any of those, aragorn kept getting them in the WOTR bookmark
-Changed end date to 99999 in hopes of fixing the CTD on load/resign (if a character has a death date beyond the mod end date, it will cause this crash) but it didnt work so the problem is somewhere else in /history folder
-Fixed rather annoying load/resign CTD. The problem was that someone had used those special dwarven/elven letters in both landes_titles and history/provinces. That causes problems - special characters like that should only be used in localisation, not directly in game files.
-Removed MEP_gondor_wotr events: They re good flavor, but it means that AI Gondor will always lose the main war because it uses up its levies in battles vs event armies before the main assault
-Fixed title history so that Rohan no longer holds half the Vale of Anduin

*Added population mechanics for Dunedain/Numenorean Group, Elves, and Dwarves.
-Their lands are either lightly populated, populated, or densely populated
-Set up starting event to populate the major areas
-When you get a new province in-game to your culture, it'll automatically be lightly populated with a -66% penalty to troops and income
-Populations can be increased via a decision, which is very costly and takes 20 years
-When a province is occupied by enemies, there is a MTTH event of 5 years which lowers the population level by one (from dense to normal, from normal to light)

-Removed shire provinces from Aragorn, it makes no sense to have the hobbits attack him with dejure cb
-Changed retinue values. Seems they no longer stack with culture, so some dunedain and elven/dwarven ones needed a stat boost
-Nerfed Isengard Uruk pits. Saruman had 45k troops, it was crazy.
-Removed file MEP_alliance.txt from events, it was all unlocalised and therefore useless until someone localises it
-Deleted orcs_decisions since it was a duplicate of MEP_orcs_decisions
-Copied over vanilla dynasty_decisions.txt, since ours was out of date and possibly not working
-Removed all special troops for now. They cause CTDs when seen on the map since a recent patch if they are not all individualy graphically defined (which I don't know how to do)
-Quite a few event and decision validator errors fixed
-Made it so that the special buildings, at least in many cases, are only in the barony where theyre supposed to be, not the whole province and sub-baronies
-Removed coat_of_arms.txt from /interface. Something in there was causing a CTD when a certain army in that region was spotted, most likely related to Rivendells Banner/COA
-Retinues were vastly overpowered, Gondor could raise something like 30,000 troops in retinues alone if at full strength. Brought them back in line with vanilla values, except that reinforce cost is still half of vanilla.
-Did some balancing of realm power by editing some buildings, it might still need some work but seems better now. Before, Saruman and Sauron won 99% of the time.
-Fixed crash with CTD on checking fort tab

-Integrated events/decisions from Way of Life and Horselords
-Updated some event files with more recent vanilla versions where I could see there was no custom content in ours
-For the event file adventures_the_old_gods.txt these cultures can spawn adventurers to take on a duchy title (orcs already have another mechanic in-game):
culture = culture_black_numenorean
culture_group = culture_barding
culture_group = culture_northmen
culture = culture_eotheod
culture = culture_rohirrim
culture = culture_hillmen
culture = culture_umbareans
-In the same event file, any character with a claim to a king title can try to take it via an adventure army (vanilla mechanic)
-Brought back the Old Gods rebel events, not sure why they were removed.
-I now know why they were removed. They're annoying as hell for a large empire. Kept the event, but reduced frequency by 75%
-Tweaked the Aragorn coronation event so he doesnt just automatically gain the extra provinces in the north. This is unfair to players who have expand that far, suddenly their lands are just taken away by event.
-Small fix for MEP_population_mechanics regarding new elven provinces not getting the lightly populated modifier. 
-Bigger fix for MEP population mechanics, it should work properly now
-Removed personalty = yes from Numenorean traits, they got randomly assigned because of it
-Restricted some Way of Life seductions so that you cant go around seducing Sauron, Eagles, Balrogs, ents, or orcs etc

*Couldnt figure out why purge province job action didn't work, so I re-did the whole thing. Now if there are hostile cultures in your realm, you get an event asking if you want to purge your land of enemies. The hostile cultured provinces get a modifier for 10 years with a +5% revolt risk, and after that, the province becomes wilderness and must be colonised again. To prevent maiar and such cultured provinces when Sauron or Saruman takes over, those provinces are immediately turned orcish, instead of wilderness. I removed the job action purge province and the purge decision - it might have worked once, but I played 50 years, and Ithilien was still full of orcs in my Aragorn game so something is clearly not working anymore.

-Removed the events giving both types of Blood of Numenor to random courtiers. It should be rare in the 3rd Age, and if there are too few, the solution is rather to give the trait to more starting nobles rather than just have a random courtier appear with a bloodline as powerful as Denethor or Aragorn...
-On that note, also changed localisation from "Drops of Numenorean Blood" to "Strong Traces of Numenorean Blood" and the strongest one is now "True Blood of Numenor"". Everyone in Gondor and Arnor have "drops", the 2nd trait is still meant to be something special.
-Reduced number of event troops Aragorn gets when he joins Rohan. Those 2.5k heavy cavalry smashes Sarumans army too easily.
-Took away lands from Boromir and Faramir. If landed, they ll often marry commoners, which many players wont like - myself included :p

-Code optimization. Moved all events that could be, to on_actions instead of MTTH.
-I m afraid I had to delete the calender events entirely - with this as MTTH:
mean_time_to_happen = {
days = 1
modifier = {
factor = 0.00001
always = yes
}
}
It is extremely resource intensive, and not worth the drain on performance for just that small yearly event notification.
-Also deleted MEP_numenor_reconquest.txt. It uses these triggers several times:
completely_controls = d_umbar ### WARNING: completely_controls is a very demanding trigger.
-Incidentally, this was the cause of the 20 day slowdown of the mod, together with the other MEP_Numenor file which inexplicably also caused huge lag.
-Deleted event where Sauron gets 1000 gold from the Variags every few months while at war. It is quite unbalancing, and there is no way that the Variags are that rich.

*Remake of colonization system. Sorry Lon, but I got too annoyed trying to colonize Annunimas and nothing happening 3 times in a row, and its always easier rebuilding an event from scratch than fixing someone else's
Features:
-Special mechanics for dunedain, you can choose to colonise with middle men at a lower cost
-If you have an elf, dwarf, or a halfling in your court you can at higher cost colonise a province with these cultures


-Changed localisation of Gondorian Commoners back to Gondorian Middlemen. It doesn't make sense to call them commoners, as they can also be nobles. Middlemen is a more accurate term, describing their lack of Dunedain "High Men" ancestry.
-Added Arnorian Middle men culture also.
-Fixed issue with commanders not working properly
-Removed these # groups from the Duchy adventure old gods event, we don't want Rohirrim and such attacking Gondor or Bardings attacking the elves and dwarves
OR = { # Only these for now
culture = culture_black_numenorean
#culture = culture_barding
#culture = culture_northmen
#culture = culture_eotheod
#culture = culture_rohirrim
culture = culture_hillmen
culture = culture_umbareans
has_character_flag = demon_child_non_pagan
}
-Temporary fix: Patricians and their families no longer get banished when good/evil side conquers and banishes the nobles of another side. This is to prevent Mordor from getting the Pelargir republic and becoming a republic himself. Placeholder fix until better one is found.

*New Blood of Numenor mechanics
-At start up, before the kinstrife bookmark, everyone of gondorian, arnorian, dunedain etc culture gets the lesser trait blood of numenor if they dont have it
-After the kinstrife, only 70% of Gondorians and Arnorians get it, while 100% of dunedain still get it
-If you lose the trait, Dunedain and Arnorians become Arnorian middle men, and Gondorians become Gondorian Middle men. Black Numenoreans can remain black numenorean cultured even if losing the trait, as there is no real need for a "black numenorean middle men" culture, and they shouldn't switch portraits to haradrim either :p

-Temporary fix. Internal version has patrician portrait bug with elves and possibly some others, i m reverting the elven, hobbit, and dwarf portrait sets to thsoe from Birthright, which do not have the patrician portrait bug - at least until Lonhaldar comes back and fixes the current versions.

	*Added event chain to get the ring by more dynamic means :
-Chances (and cost) of getting it will depend on holder's rank. Getting it from an emperor will cost 5000 gold and be almost impossible.
-Getting it from an unlanded courtier will cost 1000 gold, and have much higher chance of success

-You need at least 1000 wealth before the decision will show up

-If the heir is not of numenorean blood or half-elven/elven blood then the King will be warned his vassals may not accept him or her

WILDERNESS COLONIZATION : 
- The colonization of the wilderness provinces won't be as easy as before. Now, you'll have some new events, like an attack of wolves, a mysterious disease who'll compromise the chance to colonize correctly.
- In the same way, some new bonuses possible : you'll be able to gain new characters in your court, or to gain a new nickname.
- Colonizations will be able only once in two years.
- Vassals will be able to colonize now.

CLAIMS : 
- Dwarves will now have a claim on Moria if Sauron is defeated, and a claim on Gundbad if the Moria is reconquered.
- Every 5 years or so after 11375, Sauron gets a claim on a random bordering duchy from the "good side" cultures, to encourage mordorian expansion
- added a few events for non halfling/non-maiar ringbearers, still WIP
- added a few events for galadriel when she has ring, still WIP
- High King of hte Noldor event for Elrond if he has K_Eregion and other conditions, and also choice to re-build Eregion for his sons if Sauron is defeated
- Changed "invasion" casus belli for hostile religions/cultures so it only works on duchies not kingdoms

FLAVOUR :

- Added new special buildings : The Dome of Stars in Osgiliath east, The Tower of Ecthelion in Minas Tirith, Meduseld in Edoras, and the Hall of the Kings in Annuminas.
- Added two new titular kingdoms for historical flavour : Nogrod and Belegost.
- Added new nickname for Durin I : the Deathless
- Added new random dynasties names for Dunedain culture.

GAMEPLAY :
- General changes to racial traits, no longer inherit_chance = 100, they are given via events to those who should have them already. It should no longer be possible to get health of 100+ from marrying those with creature of melkor traits.
- Also made event that if an evil AI ruler marries an orc, he kills her once he sees her. Evil human-played rulers, however, have the option to say they rather like her and keep her.
- This should further make half-orcs very rare. Evil rulers also spawn some evil female courtiers of cult of melkor, so that they don't have to go lookign for orc brides.
- The only half-orcs (if you want to get that trait for your heirs) are now spawned in Saruman's court shortly after start-up
- Tweaked (drastically lowered in most cases) health bonuses for racial traits
- Tweaked (drastically lowered) opinion bonuses from most items 
- Increase ai_ambition for those corrupted by darkness, hopefully leading to more wars from Mordor
- Uruk Hai now also get the creature of melkor trait
- Sauron now really DOES lose the ringbearer trait when he get the ring. Alllmost sure it's fixed properly now!
*Tweaked health_events again
- Humans get the vanilla infirm-to-incapable health events
- Those with high blood of numenor get it later in life, and those with lower blood of numenor a bit earlier, but still after 100. Let us know how long people live on 
average in your games, those with health added health bonuses such as blood of isildur or elven blood on top of their numenor trait should be able to live to 200ish (if they're lucky)
- Dwarves also begin to get infirm at around 300ish years of age, but can live to 400ish if they're healthy
- Half-Elves, if anyone ever gets one, live to be 150-250ish (Yes, I know Elros lived 450ish, but this is the later 3rd age, and you're just the descendant of a silvan elf, not a royal line
with maiar blood)
- Sauron can build a 75-man Olog Hai elite retinue, they're x5 for combat purposes. Hopefully AI will use them against Dunedain doomstacks in late-game.
- Gave Barad-Dur special building more income; half the reason Sauron is inactive, I suspect, is because he is constantly broke and broke rulers can't declare war
- Gave Sauron an event to max out city and feudal taxes if they are not already; a human player can say no, of course, and won't get it again if so
- In defines.lua, changed BASE_AI_ARMY_SIZE = 40000, (it was 10,000 before). This should mean orcs should horde better together, and hopefully give an edge against the lower troop numbers of the good side
- Also reduced LEVY_MAINTENANCE_FACTOR = 1.5 to LEVY_MAINTENANCE_FACTOR = 0.75, it was only hurting Sauron who kept getting -40 income per day when he raised his hordes and spent most of the game in bankruptcy and inactive
- Nerfed halfling income buildings
*War scores
- Sometimes the war for gondor was lost as Sauron took some provinces, but the gondorian army was not defeated in the field. Changed to this in defines.lua
    SETTLEMENT_WARSCORE_MULTIPLIER = 0.1,            
    VASSAL_SETTLEMENT_WARSCORE_MULTIPLIER = 0.1,
So occupied provinces now count for only 1/3rd as they did previously. Wars now depend more on the battles won and armies defeated, not occupied land (though occupied capitals still give same warscore as before)
Increased warscore for battles by 33% to make up for this
- religious conversion of vassals now requries 10,000 piety (to prevent AI spamming it, because the event is disabled)
- Slightly increased health bonus from blood of numenors, even the ones with the strong trait could die at 80 (they should die at 120ish now, hopefully, or earlier if they get sick of course)
- Sometimes elves die of "natural reasons", health file issue? In any case, gave them 50 health bonus now, they shouldn't die
- New event to encourage Arnor and Gondor to be split into two realms if the king has an available heir to take either one; there will be opinion penalties from vassals if you do not do this due to the difficulty of administering 
two such large and distant realms at once. It triggers from 11400 onwards.
- Anyone with learning less than 20 who is not a hobbit or maiar will now begin to be corrupted by the ring over a period of time
