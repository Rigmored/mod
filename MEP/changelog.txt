-------MIDDLE-EARTH PROJECT----------
### 0.8z12 (JamesFoxBranch)
- Although elf_childhood is still controversial, I've defined mep_is_adult and mep_is_child, and I've replaced the is_adult condition with them. Checking for age limits like age = 16 and min_age = 16 could allow more complete replacement.
- The silk_road was replaced in the mod by Middle-Earth trade routes some time ago, but the buildings have never been updated to match this, so I've defined the proper triggers and editing the trade post buildings to match Middle-Earth conditions.
- As proposed by HandicapdHippo, edited the holding_types to make sure trade post slots can only be built in the right places.
- As proposed by HandicapdHippo, I've also decided to get around the pregnancy issue with long-lived races by raising the maximum age of pregnancy (from 45 to 12000), and using evens to add traits to make women infertile at appropriate ages.
- Renumbered events in MEP_wotr2.txt and MEP_wotr3.txt to make them more logical.
- Corrected spelling for the 'mouthofsauron' trait.
- Removed some additional stuff from copied vanilla events.
- Misc fixes.

### 0.8z11 (JamesFox Branch)
- fixed some mistakes I made while correcting earlier mistakes in the Andrast title histories
- Made some culture changes. Removed some unused cultures, moved Wood-Elves into a separate culture group, and the Middlemen known as Northmen were also given a culture group. Some additional cultures have been added in preparation for pushing back the history of Eraidor to early 2nd age. Since cultures are referenced extensivly in the other parts of the mod, I ended up making alterations to many buildings and events (and more) to use scripted_triggers instead of direct culture groups, and then updated the triggers with the new cultures/culture_groups. The colonization events can also handle the new elven and orcish cultures.
- Made some other culture-related tweaks along the way.
- Went over the provinces not on the map. 'Kruk Boyadla' is now back on the map, 'Hills of Sand' has been properly removed, and the others have been renamed to 'UNUSED'.
- Added some extra scripted triggers for titles.
- Added an (untested) event for the Dwarven ruler of Erebor in the WOTR bookmark, to warn the player off attacking Kazad-dûm right away, and also to remove Burin's claim on k_misty_mountains which the ai sometimes presses.
- removed duplicate elf childhood events file.
- the wotr events dispatched via morgoth should no longer show his portrait.
- Gil-Galad gets vilya in the history files.
- a few misc changes.


### 0.8z10 (JamesFox branch)
- Incorporated some additional changes from the V7 CaoJay branch.
- Updated bookmarks to reflect new government types and current cultures.
- Added Beorn as a Bear culture name.
- Found out that the missing holdings for Eastern Dwarves were caused by invalid buildings (fixed).
- Orcs and Trolls now have wives, because there is no direct way to block inter-species consorts.
- Fixed bug in purges and increasing population.
- Hobbits on fellowship should no longer get party invitations.
- Added backup frodo.50 event, so the ringbearer will attempt to destroy the ring by 11372 if the other events (frodo.9 and frodo.26) have not happened.
- disabled reclaim land event.
- added some missing localisations.
- deleted stray .bak files.

### 0.8z09 (James Fox Branch)
- Added some more things from CaoJay's branch. The main thing I've currently left out is his Rivendell setup (with Rivendell being a Kingdom and major characters there (like Arwen) holding duke level titles. Also, while Elves are no longer immortal, I have not yet removed it for others.
- Reduced ferility for Elves and Dwarves
- Fixed a few additional errors in history and events.


### 0.8z08 (JamesFox Branch)
- Many changes to vanilla events, decisions, and files in common to remove or comment out stuff that is not compatible or inapplicable to MEP.
- Occasionally added some stuff to the vanilla files to make it more applicable to MEP.
- Fixed some errors in characters (sons having same dates as parents, stray duplicates, conflicting traits).
- Fixed annuminas GFX
- Started the process of making level 2 buildings 'potential' before initial events run.
- Added some graphics from CaoJay's branch.
- Runs fine on my desktop (100 yr test), but like CaoJay's version, crashes on my laptop.
- pruning of vanilla not done, but I decided to upload the changes.

### 0.8z07 (JamesFox Branch)
- Many varied changes to get the mod working with 2.8
- fixed issued with religious and modifier icons
- events folder now overrides vanilla, copied vanilla events to be slowly pruned for compatability
- fixed various misc things revealed by error logs.

### 0.8z06 (JamesFox Branch)
- Used the Validator to identify errors in the title histories, which were all fixed.
- Edited some Character files and a few province histories to support this.
- Added d_the_shire to cover the Shire after it was founded but before the Thain (k_shire) was established.
- Extended the history of the 'wild' duchies as far back as there was wilderness available for each.
- Dale is now founded earlier, instead of 13 years before Smaug shows up.
- Please note that having no title history errors does not mean the history is good and sensible.

### 0.8z05 (JamesFox Branch)
- Fixed an error in the conclave laws (which also seems to fix a CTD).
- Fixed a few Dwarven building errors.
- Restored the 'marriedforever' event (found the mistake that caused it to trigger non-stop).

### 0.8z04 (JamesFox Branch)
- Fixed incorrect one ring artifact flag (which broke moving the one ring from one character to another).
- End of elven childhood age in trait is now 60 to match the events.
- Tweaked the 'wrong marriage' 1 and 2 conditions a bit
- The 'dwarf conquest' decisions should now be AI usable.
- added is_triggered_only to mepdeath.0
- Seems more stable than previous versions (observe usually runs around 30+ years before random CTD).


### 0.8z03 (JamesFox Branch)
- Incorporated the artifact version of the ring. Renamed trait to onering, keep because one can make the artifact
inactive under certain conditions, allowing different modifers for those using the ring, and those like hobbits
who do not have the power and knowledge to use it (to a limited extent).
- Modified events to use the artifact ring and associated traits (properly).
- Removed Dwarf Stables, the Stonefeet/Blacklock/Stiffbeard Dwarfs get heavy infantry buildings to replace thier previous elite cavalry.
- Replaced Walltower and Wall buildings for dwarven temples with the same 'Fortification' buildings that the castle and city get.
- The descriptions for colonization events now differ slightly depending on average colonization time.
- Replaced population-increase decisions with a new set of title_decisions, with associated events. These use the same
quick/cheap game rules as the colonization decision/events do.
- Still somewhat buggy.

### 0.8z02 (JamesFox branch)
- My previous fix for the the 'stray republic' issue turned out to not be a true fix. Since I could not find the real cause,
 I have rebuilt my previous changes from on older version of 0.7x16.

### 0.8z01 (JamesFox branch)
- NOTE : this is an update starting from 0.7x16c. Despite the changelog, the previous 0.8 did not include all of the changes in 0.7x16c
 (Including some changes in the MEP_frodogoestomordor.txt intended to fix problems with the WOTR event chain that people have been
 complaining about).
- Incorporated most of the changes in 0.8.
- However, the ring is still a trait for now, and I've kept elven childhood (for now?). Dwarven stables will stay until I replace them.
- The Palantir are now artifacts (I converted the events separatly, to use transfer_artifact. Also, artifact_palantir is now artifact_palantir_snor).
- Dragons are now a separate religion group (to prevent theoretical orc/troll-dragon marriage).
- disabled the 'marriedforever' event, because despite being triggered from on_death, it triggers repeatedly for living spouses.
- Created localisations for the MEP game rules
- Added and implemented game rule options for quicker and/or cheaper colonization.
- Fixed the stray republic issue affecting Eastern Dwarves (and some Orcs/Goblins).
- Not really tested much.


### 0.8x2b
- Add lorefriendly localisations for hospitals and their buildings.
- Improved reaper's due localisation to be more lore-friendly (WIP)
- Incorporated numerous fixes from cal_97 that solve courtier spam, elven death message spam, and a bug with the raiding mechanic to name a few.
- Added disease resistance / vulnerability based on population size. (eg. sparsely populated provinces recieve a +15% bonus to resisting disease while a 'greatly' populated province recieves a -15%)
- Great port of Edhellond was moved from being in the cities to the barony of Edhellond do to a sugestion from Balerion and it making sense. 
- Removed dwarven stables from game due to intense lore disparity. (Just commented them out, the localisations are still there so if you really like mounted dwarves, just uncomment the code.)
- Fixed a number of spelling / grammar errors in localisation. 
- Migrated the One Ring from trait to artifact. (Trait still exists and is used in game both to visually track who has the ring and so that a ton of events don't break.
- Added events that add/remove the "one ring" trait dependent on ownership of the ring artifact.
- Got the hunt for the one ring decision/event chain working again.  There are still some bug that need worked out though.
- Added a new wilderness character to middle earth to hold the one ring artifact during the time between isuldur losing the ring and gollum finding it. (Please give feedback on this, I still need to test having artifacts with a break in ownership.)
- *Previously, there was no holder of the ring in the kinstrife and fall of arnor bookmarks which meant there was no way for the ring to appear, unless an event was written. 

### 0.8x1b Hotfix
- Fixed the CTD and blank event screens
- Readded all content since 0.7x16c

### 0.8b
- Advanced the version forward
- Updated the credits
- Migrated the Palantiri from traits to artifacts
- Added pictures and linked the localisations for the new palantir artifacts (note the the pictures are placeholders until we get something better)

- Set up MEP_death.txt (with 3 events so far)
- implemented event to add the 'marriedforever' trait which prevents Elves from re-marrying.

### 0.7x16
- Imported a large amount of localization files for vanilla events from the Silmarilien mod. Thanks to Porkenstein and the other Silmarilien mod members.
- Tweaked my elf-courtier generator to produce 2/3rds males, to give them an extra 5 score in a random slot, and to set their immortal_age so they
never look like children (there seems to be no way to do that for existing characters).
- Defensive pacts are now turned off by deafult in the game rules.
- Feudal and Just Feudal now call tribal vassal to arms.
- As per hhardy01's request, moved Edhellond and the Drúadan Forest outside Gondor (to 'Nothing'). The Drúadan Forest is still a vassal of Gondor most of the time. Also moved Aglarond there (getting rid of k_aglarond).
- Added some modifers and events to mark being evil in a good_side court, and vice versa, as criminal.
- Tweaked/Restricted the triggers for the Red Arrow decisions/events.
- Made some edits some old events to give them pre-triggers (and get rid of the invalid age=16).

- 'Unkillable' characters now have a grealty reduced chance of dying in battle.
- Fixed some errors with population level change (thanks to HandicapdHippo).
- Colonization now gives population level 2 when done.

### 0.7x15
- To get rid of ooc revokations, I found out that they can be blocked via government type. So, new feudal government type: 'Just Feudalism' for Elves, Dwarves, Dúnedian, and some other 'Good Guys' (not all). One started, I decided to also create 'Hobbit Thaindom', 'Dark Despotism', 'Orc Despotism' and 'Wilderness' Feudal types. Iqta is renamed to to Haradrim Government.
- Also did some law editing, to make king's peace easier for 'Good Guys'
- Made some fixes to traits as per as cal97
- Fixed some errors involving flags in my wotr events (as per cal_97)
- edited MEP_wrong_marriage.txt to get rid of banishment (as per cal_97). Also added pre-triggers.

- Hobbit rulers can only have one majority party now.


### 0.7x14

- Revised the cultures allowed for the already-defined retinues (problem noted by Bloodly).
- Added events to spawn elf-courtiers who are several thousand years old. This is partly an attempt to stop the buildup of incapable 'elf-children', (as noted by Bloodly) but the additional courtiers seem to have no effect on that issue.

- Added 'religious' tolerance to the white council trait.
- Bombadil is now immune to ring corruption effects.

- Last Alliance bugfixes, added some events to disband the Last Allice once the Anti-Mordor war is over.
- Altered purge events so that rather than the completion being scheduled 10 years in-advance for the same leader only, purging-provinces are checked annually and completed if they are unoccupied and it has been 9.9 years or more since the purging started.
- Added player-only Wilderness-Colonization with Orcs/Trolls for Evil Overlords.
- Fiddled around with some race trait events, so elven childhood is applied at game start, and checks are done more frequently. 
- Event targets for many important characters set at game start.
- Made some edits to the 'Rohan-Isengard Wars' (covering Gandalf-Saruman and the Battles of the ford of Isen), that should fix some errors.
- Incorporated hhardy01's Númenórean character changes.
- The Weather Hills remain part of Arthedian until 9900 (thanks to Deaghaidh)
- Map Edits: Added the missing province Kor Mumak (thanks to Esdf20), and passages Rivendell-to-Coldfells, and Adligwold-to-Thakalgund.

- Added an event to re-imprison Morgoth if Manwë banishes or frees him.
- The Swan Knights, the Rangers of Ithilien, and the Iron Guard are now vassalized and do not exist when they should not. (Also, removed the other Rangers of Ithilien). However, they have not been fully checked for consistency (also, the Grey Company has not been touched yet).
- Imported and de-vanillified some decision and event files (often deleting all events) to try and reduce CTD/Asserts. Decisions are now MEP only.

- Arwen and Aragorn become lovers when they get married.

- Added 3 CBs inteded for use by the Reunited Kingdom (reunited_kingdom_reconquest,wilderness_arnorean,elessar_destiny_conquest)

- Added Hobbit farms
- Removed Elven beards
- Henneth Annûn is now gondorain (and has rangers)  
- fixes some bad terrain, mostly around dale

#### 0.6b HOTFIX #2 ####
- Fixed a bug where the steward can't be send to a wilderness province to colonize it.
- Added the trait "elven blood" to Elfwine the Fair, grandson of Imrahil and son of Eomer.
- Give the title of the Swans Knights of Dol Amroth to new non-dynastic characters instead of the Prince of Dol Amroth.
- The Courtiers of the Captain of the Swans Knights of Dol Amroth will have the "Knights of Dol Amroth" traits
- Gave back the Belfalas to the heirs of Imrahil during the New Shadow

#### 0.6b HOTFIX ####
- Fixed a crash because of performance in 1th february, governments vanilla values are settled
- Added several characters to Bookmarks selection screen (Fall of Arnor, Kinstrife)
- Changed death dates for numenoreans with the traits "Blood of Anarion / blood of Isildur", so they won't die around 150 years old, but around 200-220.
- Changed the max age in the ruler designer to 350 instead of 50
- Fixed a bug with bearded elves
- Fixed a bug with inheritance of elf trait / trait given to random characters
- Fixed a bug where Osgiliath is holded by the heirs of Isildur before 9980


#### 0.6b Changelog ####
- Compatibility to CKII 2.5.x
- Added two new bookmarks
- Expanded several lines to new bookmarks
- Added some new portraits
- Numenorean characters of medium blood now should die at around 120ish, those of high blood at around 150ish. This is modified by things like date (earlier bookmarks the Dunedain have not waned so much), health, whether you have elven blood or are of the royal lines, etc.
- NOT FIXED: War of the Ring event chain. It probably needs to be redone entirely. Sometimes it works brilliantly, sometimes it half works, sometimes it doesn't work at all. If you find it doesn't work and you want it to, just start over, it's only the first 5-6 years we're talking about anyways.
- Army sizes are all off, and I can't find the old settings. Increased orc levy size from 100% to 200%, gave them a bit more combat maluses. Removed combat bonuses for black numenoreans for light infantry, pikemen, archers, and light cavalry - they would use slave troops, not black numenoreans for these ranks.
- Feudal governments can now call vassals during wars. It doesn't make sense that in the wars of Middle-Earth, which tend to be quite conclusive, powerful vassals will just sit by and only give a small percentage of their troops due to some realm law or another. Wars in Middle-Earth tend to be epic all-in affairs.
- Removed elven childhood restriction for councillors. Was causing a lot of lag as AI kept appointing and then removing endlessly.
- Code optimizations, moved a lot of events to on_actions. Also deleted many not-used events from on_actions, such as the RoI ones and such. The mod still runs a bit slower than I would expect, but it's faster than Warhammer and the other big ones, though not as fast as Birthright (which is odd, since Birthright and the MEP are roughly the same size).

- A lot of the old slightly modded vanilla files were still in the mod, from several patches ago some of them. These were removed, and now the mod uses a lot more unmodded vanilla files.
- This means that until an MEP team goes through them all again with more recent versions of the files, many of the restrictions have been removed that were there previously. Sauron can take up gardening, Elrond can (probably) try to seduce Arwen, and whatever other kind of silliness that might arise. Yeah, it's not ideal, but updating all files to the more recent versions is better than having old and potentially buggy files in the mod.
- The mod now uses vanilla CBs, only slightly modded (in that holy wars cost piety and have a faster cooldown period). This means that things like subjugations etc are in.
- Generally, the mod should - hopefully - be more stable now and play more like vanilla in some areas. Restrictions we had in place that prevented dunedain vassals etc from rebelling are also removed, so you may very well now see Imrahil plotting to overthrow Denethor or have a bloody civil war in the Shire as the Tooks wage ruthless war on the Bagginses. Rivenell, Lindon, and the dwarves of the Blue Mountains also tend to expand into the wilderness duchies. Again, it's not ideal, but fixing all those old files would simply take longer than I was willing to commit to.


##### 0.5.1b Patch Changelog ##### 

- Fixed game breaking bugs after 2.4.3 
- Race traits now check real_father instead of father
- Evil rulers now have the 'create orc' decision
- Fixed broken trigger for fall of arnor event chain
- Tweaked raiding frequency
- Integrated horse lords static modifiers
- Fixed some localisations for population modifiers, titles, etc

##### 0.5b Changelog #####

TLDR:
- WoL and HL features integrated
- Perfomance massively increased
- Many bug fixes and tweaks
- Population mechanics added
- Colonisation tweaked
- Wilderness overhauled
- Playable holy orders (Swan Knights, Black Serpent)
- Map changes, Mirkwood appearance overhauled

-Removed buggy and recurring events from wotr informing that hobbits have left, and that rohan is under attack
-Deleted file MEP_Narsil, it was causing CTD with aragorn and I dont see why narsil should be so easily reforged anyways
-Removed all those wilderness holdings from Aragorn, had to give them to new wilderness chars, since he always got them even though holder was set to 0 due to inheritance i suppose
-Deleted events buildings 100, 101, and 102. They were buggy and kept repeating endlessly when holding any of those, aragorn kept getting them in the WOTR bookmark
-Changed end date to 99999 in hopes of fixing the CTD on load/resign (if a character has a death date beyond the mod end date, it will cause this crash) but it didnt work so the problem is somewhere else in /history folder
-Fixed rather annoying load/resign CTD. The problem was that someone had used those special dwarven/elven letters in both landes_titles and history/provinces. That causes problems - special characters like that should only be used in localisation, not directly in game files.
-Removed MEP_gondor_wotr events: They re good flavor, but it means that AI Gondor will always lose the main war because it uses up its levies in battles vs event armies before the main assault
-Fixed title history so that Rohan no longer holds half the Vale of Anduin

*Added population mechanics for Dunedain/Numenorean Group, Elves, and Dwarves.
-Their lands are either lightly populated, populated, or densely populated
-Set up starting event to populate the major areas
-When you get a new province in-game to your culture, it'll automatically be lightly populated with a -66% penalty to troops and income
-Populations can be increased via a decision, which is very costly and takes 20 years
-When a province is occupied by enemies, there is a MTTH event of 5 years which lowers the population level by one (from dense to normal, from normal to light)

-Removed shire provinces from Aragorn, it makes no sense to have the hobbits attack him with dejure cb
-Changed retinue values. Seems they no longer stack with culture, so some dunedain and elven/dwarven ones needed a stat boost
-Nerfed Isengard Uruk pits. Saruman had 45k troops, it was crazy.
-Removed file MEP_alliance.txt from events, it was all unlocalised and therefore useless until someone localises it
-Deleted orcs_decisions since it was a duplicate of MEP_orcs_decisions
-Copied over vanilla dynasty_decisions.txt, since ours was out of date and possibly not working
-Removed all special troops for now. They cause CTDs when seen on the map since a recent patch if they are not all individualy graphically defined (which I don't know how to do)
-Quite a few event and decision validator errors fixed
-Made it so that the special buildings, at least in many cases, are only in the barony where theyre supposed to be, not the whole province and sub-baronies
-Removed coat_of_arms.txt from /interface. Something in there was causing a CTD when a certain army in that region was spotted, most likely related to Rivendells Banner/COA
-Retinues were vastly overpowered, Gondor could raise something like 30,000 troops in retinues alone if at full strength. Brought them back in line with vanilla values, except that reinforce cost is still half of vanilla.
-Did some balancing of realm power by editing some buildings, it might still need some work but seems better now. Before, Saruman and Sauron won 99% of the time.
-Fixed crash with CTD on checking fort tab

-Integrated events/decisions from Way of Life and Horselords
-Updated some event files with more recent vanilla versions where I could see there was no custom content in ours
-For the event file adventures_the_old_gods.txt these cultures can spawn adventurers to take on a duchy title (orcs already have another mechanic in-game):
culture = culture_black_numenorean
culture_group = culture_barding
culture_group = culture_northmen
culture = culture_eotheod
culture = culture_rohirrim
culture = culture_hillmen
culture = culture_umbareans
-In the same event file, any character with a claim to a king title can try to take it via an adventure army (vanilla mechanic)
-Brought back the Old Gods rebel events, not sure why they were removed.
-I now know why they were removed. They're annoying as hell for a large empire. Kept the event, but reduced frequency by 75%
-Tweaked the Aragorn coronation event so he doesnt just automatically gain the extra provinces in the north. This is unfair to players who have expand that far, suddenly their lands are just taken away by event.
-Small fix for MEP_population_mechanics regarding new elven provinces not getting the lightly populated modifier. 
-Bigger fix for MEP population mechanics, it should work properly now
-Removed personalty = yes from Numenorean traits, they got randomly assigned because of it
-Restricted some Way of Life seductions so that you cant go around seducing Sauron, Eagles, Balrogs, ents, or orcs etc

*Couldnt figure out why purge province job action didn't work, so I re-did the whole thing. Now if there are hostile cultures in your realm, you get an event asking if you want to purge your land of enemies. The hostile cultured provinces get a modifier for 10 years with a +5% revolt risk, and after that, the province becomes wilderness and must be colonised again. To prevent maiar and such cultured provinces when Sauron or Saruman takes over, those provinces are immediately turned orcish, instead of wilderness. I removed the job action purge province and the purge decision - it might have worked once, but I played 50 years, and Ithilien was still full of orcs in my Aragorn game so something is clearly not working anymore.

-Removed the events giving both types of Blood of Numenor to random courtiers. It should be rare in the 3rd Age, and if there are too few, the solution is rather to give the trait to more starting nobles rather than just have a random courtier appear with a bloodline as powerful as Denethor or Aragorn...
-On that note, also changed localisation from "Drops of Numenorean Blood" to "Strong Traces of Numenorean Blood" and the strongest one is now "True Blood of Numenor"". Everyone in Gondor and Arnor have "drops", the 2nd trait is still meant to be something special.
-Reduced number of event troops Aragorn gets when he joins Rohan. Those 2.5k heavy cavalry smashes Sarumans army too easily.
-Took away lands from Boromir and Faramir. If landed, they ll often marry commoners, which many players wont like - myself included :p

-Code optimization. Moved all events that could be, to on_actions instead of MTTH.
-I m afraid I had to delete the calender events entirely - with this as MTTH:
mean_time_to_happen = {
days = 1
modifier = {
factor = 0.00001
always = yes
}
}
It is extremely resource intensive, and not worth the drain on performance for just that small yearly event notification.
-Also deleted MEP_numenor_reconquest.txt. It uses these triggers several times:
completely_controls = d_umbar ### WARNING: completely_controls is a very demanding trigger.
-Incidentally, this was the cause of the 20 day slowdown of the mod, together with the other MEP_Numenor file which inexplicably also caused huge lag.
-Deleted event where Sauron gets 1000 gold from the Variags every few months while at war. It is quite unbalancing, and there is no way that the Variags are that rich.

*Remake of colonization system. Sorry Lon, but I got too annoyed trying to colonize Annunimas and nothing happening 3 times in a row, and its always easier rebuilding an event from scratch than fixing someone else's
Features:
-Special mechanics for dunedain, you can choose to colonise with middle men at a lower cost
-If you have an elf, dwarf, or a halfling in your court you can at higher cost colonise a province with these cultures


-Changed localisation of Gondorian Commoners back to Gondorian Middlemen. It doesn't make sense to call them commoners, as they can also be nobles. Middlemen is a more accurate term, describing their lack of Dunedain "High Men" ancestry.
-Added Arnorian Middle men culture also.
-Fixed issue with commanders not working properly
-Removed these # groups from the Duchy adventure old gods event, we don't want Rohirrim and such attacking Gondor or Bardings attacking the elves and dwarves
OR = { # Only these for now
culture = culture_black_numenorean
#culture = culture_barding
#culture = culture_northmen
#culture = culture_eotheod
#culture = culture_rohirrim
culture = culture_hillmen
culture = culture_umbareans
has_character_flag = demon_child_non_pagan
}
-Temporary fix: Patricians and their families no longer get banished when good/evil side conquers and banishes the nobles of another side. This is to prevent Mordor from getting the Pelargir republic and becoming a republic himself. Placeholder fix until better one is found.

*New Blood of Numenor mechanics
-At start up, before the kinstrife bookmark, everyone of gondorian, arnorian, dunedain etc culture gets the lesser trait blood of numenor if they dont have it
-After the kinstrife, only 70% of Gondorians and Arnorians get it, while 100% of dunedain still get it
-If you lose the trait, Dunedain and Arnorians become Arnorian middle men, and Gondorians become Gondorian Middle men. Black Numenoreans can remain black numenorean cultured even if losing the trait, as there is no real need for a "black numenorean middle men" culture, and they shouldn't switch portraits to haradrim either :p

-Temporary fix. Internal version has patrician portrait bug with elves and possibly some others, i m reverting the elven, hobbit, and dwarf portrait sets to thsoe from Birthright, which do not have the patrician portrait bug - at least until Lonhaldar comes back and fixes the current versions.

	*Added event chain to get the ring by more dynamic means :
-Chances (and cost) of getting it will depend on holder's rank. Getting it from an emperor will cost 5000 gold and be almost impossible.
-Getting it from an unlanded courtier will cost 1000 gold, and have much higher chance of success
-The best method therefore is to defeat the emperor who has the ring and hope his heirs scatter to some insignificant court with the ring
-Beware of taking the ring if Sauron is still alive! Life expectancies drop drastically for known ringbearers who have his ring and are not in constant hiding.
-You need at least 1000 wealth before the decision will show up
	
	*Added Kinstrife event to Gondor : 
-If the heir is not of numenorean blood or half-elven/elven blood then the King will be warned his vassals may not accept him or her
-If that heir takes the throne, the vassals with the blood of numenor will attempt to find another heir of isildur who has the blood of numenor (either version)
-If that fails, a Gondorian prince with the trait will try to take the throne himself
-This starts a new kinstrife war all over gondor

- Removed the gondorian helmets for the haradrim

GAMEPLAY :

- BATTLE_WARSCORE_WORTH = 120, *was 100 before
- Minor fix so ringbearers and former ringbearers do not become incapable with age
- Added a bonus of vassal opinion for the Heir of Isildur trait.

- In the same way, some new bonuses possible : you'll be able to gain new characters in your court, or to gain a new nickname.
- Colonizations will be able only once in two years.
- Vassals will be able to colonize now.

CLAIMS : 
- Dwarves will now have a claim on Moria if Sauron is defeated, and a claim on Gundbad if the Moria is reconquered.
- Every 5 years or so after 11375, Sauron gets a claim on a random bordering duchy from the "good side" cultures, to encourage mordorian expansion
- added a few events for non halfling/non-maiar ringbearers, still WIP

- High King of hte Noldor event for Elrond if he has K_Eregion and other conditions, and also choice to re-build Eregion for his sons if Sauron is defeated

- Added two new titular kingdoms for historical flavour : Nogrod and Belegost.
- Added new nickname for Durin I : the Deathless
- Added new random dynasties names for Dunedain culture.

GAMEPLAY :
- General changes to racial traits, no longer inherit_chance = 100, they are given via events to those who should have them already. It should no longer be possible to get health of 100+ from marrying those with creature of melkor traits.
- Also made event that if an evil AI ruler marries an orc, he kills her once he sees her. Evil human-played rulers, however, have the option to say they rather like her and keep her.
- This should further make half-orcs very rare. Evil rulers also spawn some evil female courtiers of cult of melkor, so that they don't have to go lookign for orc brides.
- The only half-orcs (if you want to get that trait for your heirs) are now spawned in Saruman's court shortly after start-up
- Tweaked (drastically lowered in most cases) health bonuses for racial traits
- Tweaked (drastically lowered) opinion bonuses from most items 
- Increase ai_ambition for those corrupted by darkness, hopefully leading to more wars from Mordor
- Uruk Hai now also get the creature of melkor trait
- Sauron now really DOES lose the ringbearer trait when he get the ring. Alllmost sure it's fixed properly now!
*Tweaked health_events again
- Humans get the vanilla infirm-to-incapable health events
- Those with high blood of numenor get it later in life, and those with lower blood of numenor a bit earlier, but still after 100. Let us know how long people live on 
average in your games, those with health added health bonuses such as blood of isildur or elven blood on top of their numenor trait should be able to live to 200ish (if they're lucky)
- Dwarves also begin to get infirm at around 300ish years of age, but can live to 400ish if they're healthy
- Half-Elves, if anyone ever gets one, live to be 150-250ish (Yes, I know Elros lived 450ish, but this is the later 3rd age, and you're just the descendant of a silvan elf, not a royal line
with maiar blood)
- Sauron can build a 75-man Olog Hai elite retinue, they're x5 for combat purposes. Hopefully AI will use them against Dunedain doomstacks in late-game.
- Gave Barad-Dur special building more income; half the reason Sauron is inactive, I suspect, is because he is constantly broke and broke rulers can't declare war
- Gave Sauron an event to max out city and feudal taxes if they are not already; a human player can say no, of course, and won't get it again if so
- In defines.lua, changed BASE_AI_ARMY_SIZE = 40000, (it was 10,000 before). This should mean orcs should horde better together, and hopefully give an edge against the lower troop numbers of the good side
- Also reduced LEVY_MAINTENANCE_FACTOR = 1.5 to LEVY_MAINTENANCE_FACTOR = 0.75, it was only hurting Sauron who kept getting -40 income per day when he raised his hordes and spent most of the game in bankruptcy and inactive
- Nerfed halfling income buildings
*War scores
- Sometimes the war for gondor was lost as Sauron took some provinces, but the gondorian army was not defeated in the field. Changed to this in defines.lua
    SETTLEMENT_WARSCORE_MULTIPLIER = 0.1,            
    VASSAL_SETTLEMENT_WARSCORE_MULTIPLIER = 0.1,
So occupied provinces now count for only 1/3rd as they did previously. Wars now depend more on the battles won and armies defeated, not occupied land (though occupied capitals still give same warscore as before)
Increased warscore for battles by 33% to make up for this
- religious conversion of vassals now requries 10,000 piety (to prevent AI spamming it, because the event is disabled)
- Slightly increased health bonus from blood of numenors, even the ones with the strong trait could die at 80 (they should die at 120ish now, hopefully, or earlier if they get sick of course)
- Sometimes elves die of "natural reasons", health file issue? In any case, gave them 50 health bonus now, they shouldn't die
- New event to encourage Arnor and Gondor to be split into two realms if the king has an available heir to take either one; there will be opinion penalties from vassals if you do not do this due to the difficulty of administering 
two such large and distant realms at once. It triggers from 11400 onwards.
- Anyone with learning less than 20 who is not a hobbit or maiar will now begin to be corrupted by the ring over a period of time

MAP:
-Changed terrain of certain provinces to Forest (Mirkwood etc)
